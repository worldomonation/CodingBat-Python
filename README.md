# CodingBat-Python

This is a collection of my solutions to the popular programming practice site CodingBat.

I strived to devise a more elegant solution and so my solutions may differ from other solutions found online. Where possible I have substituted advanced Python functions in place of nested `for`, `if` and `while` loops.
